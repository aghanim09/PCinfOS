# PCinfOS

Setting up website:
- Open DEMO File in VSC
- Run Docker Engine
- run "docker compose up"
- Open localhost 8080:80

AI: 
- AI is connected to the frontend, however, in the "suggestions" page it doesn't show any recommendations as it is not connected to the backend database, with the input data.

Frontend: 
- Since we created this app for users on smartphones, we used developer tools in chrome, and selected a phone size to get an idea of what the app would look like for the users. We encourage you to do the same.
