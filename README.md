1. Setting up website:
- Open DEMO File in VSC
- Run Docker Engine
- run "docker compose up"
- Open localhost 8080:80
  
2. Frontend_AI:
- AI is connected to the frontend, however, in the "suggestions" page it doesn't show any recommendations as it is not connected to the backend database, with the input data.
- To run the frontend and AI, you will need xampp with apache started
- Note:  Since we created this app for users on smartphones, we used developer tools in chrome, and selected a phone size to get an idea of what the app would look like for the users. We encourage you to do the same.
